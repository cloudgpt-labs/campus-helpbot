# Campus HelpBot – Build an AI Assistant with Azure

Welcome! This is **Campus HelpBot**, a hands-on project where you’ll build an AI-powered assistant for students using Microsoft Azure’s AI services.

We’ll walk through the process of integrating GPT, Computer Vision, Search, and Bot services — all while solving real-world campus use cases like answering FAQs, scanning notes, and making course recommendations.

No theory overload — just practical learning, real demos, and project-based progress.

## What You’ll Learn

As you build the Campus HelpBot, you’ll gain hands-on experience with:

- Natural Language Processing using **Azure OpenAI**
- Document analysis with **Form Recognizer**
- Intelligent search using **Cognitive Search**
- Multilingual support with **Translator**
- Text-to-Speech for accessibility
- Building and deploying bots with **Azure Bot Framework**
- Responsible AI practices and moderation
- Hosting and integrating everything in a working app

## What the App Can Do

> _Imagine this…_ A student uploads handwritten notes, asks the bot “What’s the exam policy?”, and gets a friendly, spoken response in their preferred language — all powered by Azure AI.

Here’s what Campus HelpBot will eventually handle:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| GPT-powered Q&A | Answers common student questions |
| Handwritten note parser | Scans notes and extracts key content |
| Handbook search | Finds information from student handbook PDFs |
| Language translation | Understands and responds in multiple languages |
| Text-to-speech | Reads back schedules or announcements |
| Course recommendations | Suggests electives based on interest |
| Sentiment feedback | Analyzes feedback on events or facilities |
